The query filtered for campaigns with \"Keyword Targeting\" and \"sponsored brands\" within the last 14 days.\n\nThe formula used to calculate ACOS is the total advertising spend divided by the total advertising revenue, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. The keywords were then grouped by targeting and sorted by total advertising spend in descending order.\n\nThe data shows keywords like 'diamond heart stud earrings', 'heart stud earrings for women', and 'diamond square stud earrings for women' with their corresponding total advertising spend. However, there is no data available for ACOS percentage or total advertising revenue for these keywords. The trends in the data indicate which keywords are costing more in advertising spend within the specified campaign type and timeframe.",
